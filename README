# Backbone.localStorage

Quite simply a localStorage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a localStorage database.

## Usage

    window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.Extend({
      
      localStore: new Store("SomeCollection"); // Unique name within your app.
      
      // ... everything else is normal.
      
    });
    
Feel free to use Backbone as you usually would, this is a drop-in replacement.
